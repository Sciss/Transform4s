## statement

This is a library for FFT based transformations. It is a direct translation from Java to Scala of parts
of the [JTransforms](https://github.com/wendykierp/JTransforms) library (C)opyright by Piotr Wendykier. 
All adaptations and Scala translation (C)opyright 2020â€“2021 by Hanns Holger Ruz. This project is released
under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1+.

__Why?__ Because I need a library that can compile both the JVM and JS. In the future, compiling to
Scala Native might also be useful.

__What?__

- Removed all dependencies on other Java libraries (e.g. Apache Commons FastMath, at least for now)
- Removed API unsupported by Scala.js (e.g. Java Logging, Java concurrency). On the JVM, you can still
  run the algorithms multi-threaded if desired.
- Removed the Large Array support (not needed in my case,  another Java dependency).

## building

This project builds with sbt against Scala 2.13, 2.12, Dotty (JVM) and 2.13 (Scala.js).

## linking

The following artifact is necessary as dependency:

    libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" %% "transform4s" % v

The current version `v` is `"0.1.1"`

## limitations

- Currently, the number of transforms converted to Scala is very low. In the future, more and more of
  JTransform's classes could be added: `DoubleFFT1_D`, `DoubleFFT2_D`. Credits: The translations are mostly
  mechanical through IntelliJ IDEA's Java-to-Scala translator, plus a bit of manual clean-up.

- Unit tests have not been converted yet. In other words, no guarantee that the code translation is
  correct (even though likely due to the mechanical process)

- in the future, we might use `Float64Array` on Scala.js for better performance
